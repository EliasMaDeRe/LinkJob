We find that pull requests against small, clear user stories coupled with thorough, well-written test cases make for easy reviews. We want to keep review time low and minimize the amount of work in progress.MeetingsWe keep meetings to a minimum, because work rarely gets done in meetings.Deep WorkWe encourage deep work. Sign out of Slack and focus without interruption for at least 4 hours every day if you can. We have escalation procedures to deal with emergencies which means the majority of the dev team is never “on call”.Mentoring and LeadershipIf you like mentoring other developers, or working with the leadership team to set priorities and fix process, there’s plenty of room for that.
