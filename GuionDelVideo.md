How many of you have heard about the high demand of software engineers in the field? Raise your hand. Now, how many of you actually know what companies are looking for today? Are these jobs on site? Are they remote? What does the average salary look like? Do big tech companies pay more than small start-ups? Are they even available in your place of residence? We had the same questions and we came up with a solution.

We believe that access to these key pieces of information can help any upcoming engineer decide on the career path they want to take. Our target audience and users are third year students enrolled in a Software Engineering B.S. degree, since they are the ones that already have strong fundamentals but are looking to put them into practice, develop leadership skills and get an advantage when pursuing a permanent position.

Our project will make use of the Web scraping technique to collect content and key data from the job search engine “Glassdoor”, where the information is available for current job offerings. Although the information is already available, Glassdoor lacks an important amount of search filters and archiving past job offers, so these are the two main objectives that we want to tackle with our project. After doing some research and thoroughly discussing it within our team and with our mentor and professor Dr. Edgar Cambranes we have come up with the following functionalities.

A wide variety of filters that our users can apply to get a graphic visualization of the data of the past job offerings within a time frame that they specify. 
There is a maximum of two filters that can be applied to get even more precise information on relevant data of past job offers that they want to visualize.
The system will make graphs for the following time frames of the data: 1 month, 6 months and 12 months old. This means the user will be able to consult information that is no longer available on glassdoor through our system.
Our user will also be able to visualize the demand of technologies in current job offers. This, in addition to being able to retrieve past information, will help to visualize the change of demand of said technologies.

These functionalities and their specifications can be consulted on our project's public repository.
