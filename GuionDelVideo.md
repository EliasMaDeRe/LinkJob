How many of you have heard about the high demand of software engineers in the field? Raise your hand. Now, how many of you actually know what companies are looking for today? Are these jobs on site? Are they remote? What does the average salary look like? Do big tech companies pay more than small start-ups? Are they even available in your place of residence? We had the same questions and we came up with a solution.

We believe that access to these key pieces of information can help any upcoming engineer decide on the career path they want to take. Our target audience and users are third year students enrolled in a Software Engineering B.S. degree, since they are the ones that already have strong fundamentals but are looking to put them into practice, develop leadership skills and get an advantage when pursuing a permanent position.

Our project will make use of the Web scraping technique to collect content and key data from the job search engine “Glassdoor”, where the information is available for current job offerings. Although the information is already available, Glassdoor lacks an important amount of search filters and archiving past job offers, so these are the two main objectives that we want to tackle with our project. After doing some research and thoroughly discussing it within our team and with our mentor and professor Dr. Edgar Cambranes we have come up with the following functionalities.

A wide variety of filters that our users can apply to get a graphic visualization of the data of the past job offerings within a time frame that they specify. 
There is a maximum of two filters that can be applied to get even more precise information on relevant data of past job offers that they want to visualize.
The system will make graphs for the following time frames of the data: 1 month, 6 months and 12 months old. This means the user will be able to consult information that is no longer available on glassdoor through our system.
Our user will also be able to visualize the demand of technologies in current job offers. This, in addition to being able to retrieve past information, will help to visualize the change of demand of said technologies.

These functionalities and their specifications can be consulted on our project's public repository. 

Now that we have mentioned how our program works in general we can go deeper and talk about the use cases and the actors that will interact with the system.

  

We will have two actors that intervene in our system, the user who can select the filters they want in relation to their needs and visualize the information represented by bar graphs that the software generates, on the other hand, the developer can go deeper into the system and be able to manage the database, the information collector, the graph generator, archiver and graph presentator.

  

During these past few months of working on the project, a very important aspect that we had left out while working as a team, was activity logging and monitoring. We had previously been working using nothing more but google docs and whatsapp for checking in in our tasks. Although we did have a digital logbook where we distributed the tasks and times to deliver them, we didn’t really have a system to make sure the assignments were done correctly and in a way that makes sense for the project. These mistakes came to light when during one of our weekly sessions with professor Cambranes, some of the uploaded work was not coherent with some of our other assignments. We quickly realized that this negligence would hold us back from actually working in a timely manner and achieving our goals with the project. One of the things that we implemented to solve this, was scheduling meetings in between our usual weekly sessions to further increase our communication so that everyone stays updated while working on the project. We also started logging observations and correctos for every task assigned.

  

Finally, throughout the process we kept a logbook to keep track of the assignments and the difficulty and work involved in them. We tried to split the assignments in a way that would allow everyone to have a relevant participation in the project. We achieved this by assigning points depending on the amount of work needed to fulfill an assignment. We believe to have successfully done this as every participant on the project has an equivalent of 20% participation on the work done and this is backed up by the logbook. This can also be consulted on our project’s repository.

  

This is the end of our first update on the work done and the process of the first evaluation of the project. Thank you.
